# Fullstack Vue

## Testing - Basics

1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.

2. Install the dependencies

````
npm install
````

3. Boot the app

````
npm run serve
````

The server is now running - watch the console output for instructions, but by default, your server is now running (with hot reload) at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

4. Run unit tests of working file

````
npm run test
````

5. Run unit tests of working file, in watch mode

````
npm run test:watch
````

6. Run all unit tests

````
npm run test:unit
````

7. summary

the Mocha testing library and Chai assertions. We’ve covered the benefits to using vue-test-utils
and the importance of shallow rendering.
